//	The following use the same syntax as the ones in GNUstep. Just cuz that's
//	the closest we have to a standard for stuff like this.
//
//	Create a pool around some code by doing:
//		CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL(myPool);
//			// Use the pool.
//		DESTROY(myPool);
//
//	ASSIGN() is a neat macro to use inside mutators, DESTROY() is a shorthand
//	that lets you release an object and clear its variable in one go.
//
//	The do/while(0) stuff is just there so the macro behaves just like any other
//	function call, as far as if/else etc. are concerned.

// PROPERTY(propertyName) --> @"propertyName"
//	The following macro is for specifying property (ivar) names to KVC or KVO methods.
//	These methods generally take strings, but strings don't get checked for typos
//	by the compiler. If you write PROPERTY(fremen) instead of PROPERTY(frame),
//	the compiler will immediately complain that it doesn't know the selector
//	'fremen', and thus point out the typo. For this to work, you need to make
//	sure the warning -Wunknown-selector is on.
//
//	Thanks to the NO ? trick goes to Rob Rix. This means that the NSStringFromSelector()
//	is compiled (and causes errors with invalid selectors) but is never used at runtime
//	(so performance of debug and non-debug builds stays identical).

#if DEBUG
#define PROPERTY(propName)	((^{(void)@selector(propName); return nil;})(), @#propName)
#else
#define PROPERTY(propName)	@#propName
#endif


// KEYPATH(obj,key.path.on.object) --> @"key.path.on.object"
//	The following macro is like PROPERTY, but for entire key paths. Thanks to
//	Rob Rix for donating this. The else case essentially returns NIL cast to NSString*,
//	but in the process of determining the type happens to validate our path as a side effect.
//	Since the else case is unreachable, this has the same runtime effect as specifying a string
//	constant, but it is type-checked.
//	You only pass in 'obj' to allow determining the type. It doesn't actually call anything.

#if DEBUG
#define KEYPATH(OBJ, PATH) (YES ? @ # PATH : (__typeof__(^ NSString * { (void)((__typeof__(OBJ))nil).PATH; return nil; }())) nil)
#else
#define KEYPATH(OBJ, PATH) (@ # PATH)
#endif
